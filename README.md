Playing the Game <br>

Save Our Planet is a turn based board game which the players play in sequential turns. <br>

The current player will throw two virtual six sided dice to move around the board. <br>

The game system will tell the current player where they have landed and the current <br>
obligations or opportunities available to them in a list. <br>
The Game will notify the player when resources change after each action. <br>

The winner of the game is determined by: <br>
The first player to reduce their carbon footprint balance to zero, thereby saving the planet, or
the player with the lowest carbon footprint when the game reaches the maximium turn limit, or 
the player with the lowest carbon footprint when the players choose to quit the game early.
